# MED-Aid Mobile

React Native mobile application (optional - PWA is recommended).

## Status

⚠️ **Note:** The web app has PWA support and works excellently on mobile. This React Native implementation is optional and not actively maintained.

## Setup

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
```

## Run

```bash
# iOS
npm run ios

# Android
npm run android
```

## Recommended Approach

Use the PWA version instead:
1. Open https://medaiii.vercel.app on mobile
2. Add to Home Screen
3. Enjoy native-like experience

## Development

The mobile app shares code structure with the web app and uses the same Supabase backend.
